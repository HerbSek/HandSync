# Hand Sync

This project utilizes OpenCV, MediaPipe, and PyAutoGUI to track hand movements and control the mouse cursor based on hand gestures. The system captures live video from the webcam, processes the hand landmarks, and moves or drags the mouse based on specific hand gestures.

Features
1. Hand Detection and Tracking: Uses MediaPipe to detect and track hand landmarks in real-time.
2. Mouse Movement Control: Moves the mouse cursor to the position of the index finger tip.
3. Mouse Dragging: Initiates a drag operation when the thumb and index finger are close together.
4. Real-time Processing: Processes the video stream in real-time with minimal delay.
5. Visual Feedback: Displays the processed video feed with hand landmarks and interactions highlighted.
